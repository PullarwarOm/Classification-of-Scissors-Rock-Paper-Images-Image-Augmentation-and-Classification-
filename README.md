# Classification of Scissors Rock Paper Images Image Augmentation and Classification
Using Deep Learning model with conjunction of Image Augmentation to classify hand gestures into Rock, Paper, Scissor
- Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
- The rps dataset contains images from a variety of different hands, from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such. Here are a few examples showing some of the poses, and the diversity of hand model used.
- Here, I have created appropriate folder structure on disk (or google drive) as per the requirement of Image Generator for "rps-training-set.zip", "rps-testing-set.zip" and "rps-validation-set.zip" containing the images of rock, paper and scissors images. And then used them for training, testing and validation respectively.
